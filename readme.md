[RYM](https://rateyourmusic.com/) (soon to be Sonemic) is a music site much like IMDb for rating, cataloging, and finding new music.
The advance tracklist input for adding a new album to the site is of the format:

TRACK #|TRACK NAME|TRACK DURATION

I've been using iTunes as a source for a while, and getting it into that format through text manipulation.

But that's stupid so I am writing this.
