[RYM](https://rateyourmusic.com/) (soon to be Sonemic) is a music site much like IMDb for rating, cataloging, and finding new music.

TRACK NUM|TRACK NAME|TRACK DURATION

I was using iTunes as a source for a while, and getting it into that format through text manipulation.
But that's stupid so I wrote this.
